    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lectures, we've seen that this course addresses the control of dynamical systems. Two key course objectives are to understand how to analyze and synthesize systems to achieve specific goals. To do this effectively, we need to understand various ways of representing and analyzing dynamical systems mathematically.\n",
    "In this notebook, we delve deeper into some fundamental concepts and techniques used in control systems analysis. We'll explore system responses and different system representations.\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and analyze a system's response to exponential inputs.\n",
    "- Interpret and work with transfer functions.\n",
    "- Convert between state-space models and transfer functions, and understand the benefits of each representation.\n",
    "- Appreciate the role of Laplace transforms in control systems analysis and how they relate to system behavior.\n",

    "# Motivation\n",
    "In Lecture 4, we observed that analyzing the time response of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system can be quite challenging. The response is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = Ce^{At}x(0) + C\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(t-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau)d\\tau + Du(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula provides a complete characterization of the output response of an LTI system. However, the convolution integral makes it difficult to analyze the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the question: how can we effectively analyze the response of a system to more complex inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we will study the response of LTI systems to elementary inputs such as a step and an impulse. These inputs are particularly easy to analyze because the input has the same form as the output and are very rich, meaning they can be used to describe any other input through linear combinations.\n"

    "# 1. Exponential Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will study the response of an LTI system to an exponential input. The exponential input is a particularly interesting input because it is an eigenfunction of the system. This means that the output of the system will be a scaled version of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Exponential Input\n",
    "\n",
    "An exponential input is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(t) = e^{st}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real Exponential**: If $s$ is real, then $u(t) = e^{st}$ is a simple exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sinusoidal**: If $s = j\\omega$ is purely imaginary, then $u(t) = e^{j\\omega t}$ represents a sinusoidal signal:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$u(t) + u^*(t) = e^{j\\omega t} + e^{-j\\omega t} = 2\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponentially Modulated Sinusoid**: If $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$, then:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$u(t) + u^*(t) = e^{\\sigma t}e^{j\\omega t} + e^{\\sigma t}e^{-j\\omega t} = 2e^{\\sigma t}\\cos(\\omega t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a sinusoid with exponentially changing amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Response to Exponential Input\n",
    "\n",
    "For an LTI system described by the state-space equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\dot{x}(t) &= Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\\\\\\n",
    "y(t) &= Cx(t) + Du(t)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The response to an exponential input $u(t) = e^{st}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = Ce^{At}x(0) + C\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\tau)}Be^{s\\tau} d\\tau + De^{st}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = \\underbrace{Ce^{At}\\left(x(0) - (sI - A)^{-1}B\\right)}_{\\text{Transient Response } \\rightarrow 0 \\text{ (if as. stable)}} + \\underbrace{\\left(C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\\right)e^{st}}_{\\text{Steady-State Response}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<small><small>\n",
    "See Lecture 5 page 7 for the derivation\n",
    "</small></small>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- The first term represents the transient response\n",
    "- The second term represents the steady-state response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steady-State Response\n",
    "\n",
    "For an asymptotically stable system, the transient response will converge to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. The steady-state response is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{ss}(t) = G(s)e^{st}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$ is the transfer function of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property makes exponential inputs particularly useful for analyzing LTI systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It allows us to easily compute the frequency response of the system by setting $s = j\\omega$.\n",
    "2. It forms the basis for Laplace transform analysis, as we can express any input as a sum of exponentials.\n",
    "3. It helps us understand the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the context of dynamic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: First-Order System\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a first-order system with transfer function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which could represent a simple RC circuit. We'll examine the system's response to a real exponential input $u(t) = e^{st}$."
