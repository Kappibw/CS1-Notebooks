    "\n",
    "Having a model of the system allows us to analyze the system, synthesis a control algorithm and test this on a simulation using said model.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this lecture we mostly assume that we have a model at hand but coming up with one is a big part of being a control engineer thus we will give you a quick introduction to system modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the lecture about modeling, *\"All Models are wrong, some are useful\"*. This is due to the fact that it is infeasible and/or impossible to perfectly capture the physics behind a system.\n",

    "# Modeling Approaches\n",
    "Let us now got through the steps of modeling a system.\n",
    "## General Steps\n",
    "### 1. System Boundaries, Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "First we must define the boundaries of the systems, which in turn defines the inputs and outputs of the system. During this step we also define the system states which in turn define the complexity of the system.\n",
    "1. **Boundaries:** The boundaries of the system define what quantities are worth keeping track off (i.e. become system states) and what quantities will become inputs or outputs.   \n",
    "This may sound trivial but it is an important first step of defining the model complexity.   \n",
    "For example while modeling a car it would not make sense to include a meteorological model of the winds affecting the car. Instead the winds will be introduced as an outside disturbance (input to the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inputs:** The inputs to a system define how the outside world affects the system itself. This includes both, the general environment and possibly some user with some goal of controlling the system for a specific task.   \n",
    "For example while controlling the temperature of water in a faucet, it is affected by both the user controlling the knob and the heat dissipation in the plumbing.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Hence, inputs can be separated into:\n",
    "   * Endogenous inputs: Inputs which can be controlled. These are in general the control inputs (for example the faucet knob or the gas throttle from a car).\n",
    "   * Exogenous inputs: Inputs which the user has no control over. These are usually (not always) disturbances.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   One has to be careful with the terminology as inputs can also be negative such as a leak in a water tank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outputs:** The outputs of a system are the measurements or observations we make of the system.  \n",
    "These can be separated in:\n",
    "* Measured outputs, quantities we can measure directly such as the speed of a car.\n",
    "* Performance outputs which we can't measure directly but would also like to control, for example the fuel efficiency of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **System State**\n",
    "We have described on how the system is affected and how we can observe it. But we still haven't described how the system changes *internally* and what we actually mean by *the system*. The actual system is described by its system state. It is a set of numbers/quantities describing the system. For example in the car exercise the system is described by the position of the car and the velocity of the car, thus the system state is described by $x(t) = [p(t), \\dot p(t)]^T$. The system state completely describes the system, like a sort memory of the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the above aspects can be controlled while deriving a model, meaning we can choose what quantities will be captured in the model. Thus to some extend we can choose the inputs to our system and we can control the outputs of our systems by using different sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example on how we can choose those aspects, we look at Problem Set 1 Question 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model we included the drag force, roll resistance, traction (engine model) and gravity as inputs to the system.   \n",
    "Another valid choice for inputs would be to ignore the drag force and only look at the roll resistance, traction and gravity.   \n",
    "Whether this is a good choice or not is an entirely separate question but it would be a valid model of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand one could make the model more complex and introduce the model that calculates the traction torque explicitly.\n",
    "This would increase the scope of the system as new quantities such as temperatures and pressures inside the motor become relevant.\n",
    "This again would be valid but maybe it would be to complicated for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we can also change the outputs of the system. We are not limited to measuring the velocity of the car but we could also include a GPS device and measure the position explicitly.    \n",
    "If this is a good choice is questionable as the velocity is the only relevant quantity for cruise control.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that we have a big say in the system design and modelling decisions. The knowledge for choosing these aspects usually comes with experience and deeper understanding of control theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Writing Down the Differential Equations\n",
    "Once the system boundaries, inputs and outputs are defined the differential equations of the system need to be derived.   \n",
    "There are different approaches to doing this, but often this is done using so called storage variables (such as energy, temperature, mass, momentum, cash, etc), and how different inflows and outflows change these storage variables (mass flow, power heat flow, payments, etc.). The storage variables are usually system states and the inflows and outflows are usually the inputs to the system. Once these storage variables are defined and the inflows and outflows are known we can setup the differential equation using:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\text{storage} = \\sum \\text{inflows} - \\sum \\text{outflows}$$\n",
    "Most physical laws can be interpreted or rewritten as a variation of the storage approach. Thus it is often more convenient to use these laws to directly setup the differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some of the common formulas used (with $\\dot \\square$  indicating the time derivative):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Newton's 2nd Law for Linear Translation:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum F(t) = m a(t) = m \\dot v(t) = m \\ddot x(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $\\sum F(t)$ being the sum of all forces, $m$ being the mass of the object, $a(t)$ the acceleration, $v(t)$ the velocity and $x(t)$ the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Newton's 2nd Law for Rotation:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum T(t) = J \\ddot \\theta(t) = J \\dot \\omega (t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $\\sum T(t)$ being the sum of all torques, $J$ being the Moment of Inertia, $\\omega(t)$ being the rotational velocity, and $\\theta(t)$ being the rotation angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heat Transfer (Fourier's Law):**\n",
    "\n",
    "A heat flow from surface i too surface j of a wall is proportional to the difference of temperatures: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot Q_{ij}(t) = c_{ij} (T_i(t)-T_j(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $c_{ij}$ being a constant related to the two surfaces and the wall between.<br>\n",
    "Having a heat flow into a room from different surfaces we have the following temperature equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C \\dot T(t) = \\sum \\dot Q(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $C$ being the thermal capacity of that room.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductance:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(t) = L \\dot I(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $U(t)$ being the voltage, $L$ the inductance and $I(t)$ the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacitance:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(t) = C \\dot U(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $U(t)$ being the voltage, $C$ the capacitance and $I(t)$ the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Writing Down in Standard Form\n",
    "Every control system has different quantities to keep track of, different inputs, outputs, state and most importantly different orders of derivatives.\n",
    "As this variety in models(variable names, derivative orders, inputs, output) would make it difficult to come up with unified theories that can be applied to all control systems it is important to write down the differential equations in a standard form, which looks like this:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "This ensures that all system have the same form and results are easily transferable.\n",
    "In this formulation $f(x(t), u(t))$ is called the dynamics model and $h(x(t), u(t))$ is called the measurement model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the systems are not standard form and mostly include higher order derivatives. To convert these higher order systems to standard form we need to use a trick from Linear Algebra that every higher derivative can be reformulated as a system of first order derivatives.\n",

    "## PS1 Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is a simulation of the reverse pendulum exercise (PS1 Exercise 3). \n",
    "When you first run the code you can see how the system naturally behaves. It starts upright until at $t=3$ an impulse torque notches the pendulum out of its unstable equilibrium. The pendulum then swings down and approaches its stable equilibrium (being at 180° ($\\pi$ rad)). This is what we would expect from this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the goal is to introduce a feedback controller to stabilize the system to an upright position. \n",
    "For this we will first introduce the simplest controller imaginable. \n",
    "Lets say we want the system to be at the desired angle $\\theta_{ref} = 0$.\n",
    "We can then define the error of the system as the deviation of the angle from the reference angle:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e(t) = \\theta_{ref}-\\theta(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can then say the controller should input a control signal proportional to the error:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_p(t) = K_p \\cdot e(t)\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "To see what happens you can turn on the controller and increase the $K_p$ slider.\n",
    "One can see that in the beginning the control is not able to reach the desired state of $\\theta = 0$ since to little effort is made.\n",
    "As one increases the $K_p$ gain the controller approaches the desired state of $\\theta = 0$. This is certainly a controller that works but one can see that the controller overshoots. The larger the gain the higher the overshoot. This overshooting (going above or below the desired goal) can be mitigated by introducing a damping term in the controller. For this we calculate the rate of change of the error (i.e. are we make a lot of progress towards the right direction or not). We define:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot e(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta_{ref}- \\theta(t)) \\underbrace{=}_{\\text{since } \\dot \\theta_{ref}\\text{ is zero}} - \\dot \\theta(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We now introduce this term into the control input as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{PD}(t) = K_p \\cdot e(t) + K_d \\cdot \\dot e(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a so called PD-Controller which you will encounter later in this course. \n",
    "To see the effect increase the $K_d$ gain slider and see how the system overshoot is smaller.\n",
    "One can interpret this as a sort of damping, when we are moving fast towards the desired goal the controller backs of to \"gently\" approach the desired goal.\n",
    "Feel free to play around with different values of $K_p$ and $K_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly one can also see the effect of feedback being negative. If the $K_d$ gain is zero and the $K_p$ gain is to large the system starts to become unstable.\n",
    "This nicely demonstrates that one has to be careful when implementing feedback as in the worst case a rogue controller will damage or destroy your system."
