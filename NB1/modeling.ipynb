    "(System) Modeling for control systems is figuring out the **relationship between the input(s) and output(s)** of a system.<br>\n",
    "Usually this means that we want to write down the **Differential Equations (PDE/ODE)** that govern the underlying system we want to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a model of the system allows us to analyze the system, synthesis a control algorithm and test this on a simulation using said model.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this lecture we mostly assume that we have a model at hand but coming up with one is a big part of being a control engineer thus we will give you a quick introduction to system modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the lecture about modeling, *\"All Models are wrong, some are useful\"*. This is due to the fact that it is infeasible and/or impossible to perfectly capture the physics behind a system.\n",
    "Thus the underlying model will always only be an approximation of reality and one needs to keep this in mind while creating and utilizing a model.\n"

    "# Modeling Approaches\n",
    "## General Steps\n",
    "### 1. System Boundaries, Inputs and Outputs\n",
    "First we must define the boundaries of the systems, which in turn defines the inputs and outputs of the system. During this step we define the complexity of the system.\n",
    "1. **Boundaries:** The boundaries of the system define what quantities are worth keeping track off (i.e. become system states) and what quantities will become inputs or outputs.   \n",
    "This may sound trivial but it is an important first step of defining the model complexity.   \n",
    "For example while modeling a car it would not make sense to include a meteorological model of the winds affecting the car. Instead the winds will be introduced as an outside disturbance (input to the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inputs:** The inputs to a system define how the outside world affects the system itself. This includes both, the general enviornment and possibly some user with some goal of controlling the system for a specific task.   \n",
    "For example while controlling the temperature of water in a faucet, it is affected by both the user controlling the knob and the heat dissipation in the plumbing.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Hence, inputs can be separated into:\n",
    "   * Endogenous inputs: Inputs which can be controlled. These are in general the control inputs (for example the faucet knob or the gas throttle from a car).\n",
    "   * Exogenous inputs: Inputs which the user has no control over. These are usually (not always) are usually disturbances   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   One has to be careful with the terminology as inputs can also be negative such as a leak in a water tank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outputs:** The outputs of a system are the measurements or observations we make of the system.  \n",
    "These can be separated in:\n",
    "* Measured outputs, quantities we can measure directly such as the speed of a car.\n",
    "* Performance outputs which we can't measure directly but would also like to control, for example the fuel efficiency of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the aspects can be controlled while deriving a model, meaning we can choose what quantities will be captured in the model, we can to some extend choose the inputs (usually the control inputs) to our system and we can control the outputs of our systems by using different sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example on how we can choose those aspects, we look at Problem Set 1 Question 2:\n",
    "In this model we included the drag force, roll resistance, traction (engine model) and gravity as inputs to the system.   \n",
    "Another valid choice for inputs would be to ignore the drag force and only look at the roll resistance, traction and gravity.   \n",
    "Whether this is a good choice or not is an entirely seperate question but it would be a valid model of the system.    \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand one could make the model more complex and introduce the model that calculates the traction torque explicitly.\n",
    "This would increase the scope of the system as new quantities such as temperatures and pressures become relevant besides to the car velocity and position become relevant.   \n",
    "This again would be valid but maybe it would be to complicated for the task at hand.   \n",
    "Lastly we can also change the outputs of the system. We are not limited to measuring the velocity of the car but we could also include a GPS device and measure the position explicitly.    \n",
    "If this is a good choice is questionable as the velocity is the only relevant quantity for cruise control.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. System States\n",
    "We have desciribed on how the system is affected and how can we observe it. But we stil haven't described how the system changes *internally*. That is what we call the **state** of a system. It is a set of numbers/quantities describing the system. For the model in question a state essentailly perfectly and completely describs the system, like a memory of the stystem is on the inside.   \n",
    "A variety of quantities can form the state of the system. It can be output quantities like the velocity of a car. It can also include storage quantities like momentum, energy etc. By definition, a state is limited by anything. any quantity necessary in describing the interal memery of the system is a part of the state.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Writing Down the Differential Equations\n",
    "Once the system boundaries, inputs and outputs are defined the differential equations of the system need to be derived.   \n",
    "There are different approaches to doing this, but often this is done using so called storage variables (such as energy, temperature, mass, momentum, cash, etc), whihc are generally the states and how different inflows and outflows change these storage variables (mass flow, power heat flow, payments, etc.) whihc are generally the inputs. Once these storage variables are defined and the inflows and outflows are known we can setup the differential equation using:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\text{storage} = \\sum \\text{inflows} - \\sum \\text{outflows}$$\n",
    "Most known physical laws can be interpreted or rewritten as a variation of the storage approach. For example the well known Newton formula\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = ma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "does not necessarily look like storage formulation in a classical sense but as you will learn in Mechanics III is a special case a momentum change.\n",
    "This means that a lot of the time it is more convenient to use equations one has experience with to directly derive the differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What examples should I make here?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Writing Down in Standard Form\n",
    "Every control system has different quantities to keep track of, different inputs, outputs, state and most importantly different orders of derivatives.\n",
    "As this variety in models(variable names, derivative orders, inputs, output) would make it difficult to come up with unified theories that can be applied to all control systems it is important to write down the differential equations in a standard form, which looks like this:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot x (t) = f(x(t), u(t))\\\\\n",
    "y(t) = h(x(t), u(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This ensures that all system have the same form and results are easily transferable.\n",
    "In this formulation $f(x(t), u(t))$ is called the dynamics model and $h(x(t), u(t))$ is called the measurement model.\n",
    "To end up in this formulation one first defines the inputs as a input vector $u(t)$, then define the outputs/measurements as an output vector $y(t)$ and lastly define the system states as state vector $x(t)$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "But more often than not, it is not possible to derive the equations for the system in the standard form. So after the differential equations are derived they are generally recast inot the standard form afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leta take this example differential equation here\n",
    " $$\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \\theta + \\frac{g}{l}sin(\\theta) = 0$$  \n",
    " $$ y = \\theta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "At a first glance it is not in the standard form, but looks similar. The main probelm is the derivative. So how do we resolve that?   \n",
    "\n",
    "*We introduce an extra state*. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we define our state to be $$ x = [\\theta, \\dot \\theta]^T$$ and we can write it as \n",
    "$$ \\dot x_1 = x_2 $$\n",
    "$$ \\dot x_2 = -\\frac{g}{l} x_1 $$\n",
    "$$ y = x_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we have them is the standard form (The first two equation for the dynamics model and the last euation is the measuement model).  \n",
    "This is one way. There is other ways as well to put the derived differential equations in the stsandard form."
