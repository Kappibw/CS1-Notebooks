    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Causal System**: A system where the output at time $t$ can depend on future inputs (after time $t$). \n",

    "1. **Static System**: A system where the output at time $t$ depends only on the input at time $t$.\n",
    "   In other words, the system has no memory of past inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic System**: A system where the output at time $t$ depends on the input at time $t$ and past inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a static system is a **volume knob on a speaker**. The volume level is always controlled by the current position of the knob, without any consideration of previous settings. No matter how much the knob was turned earlier, the current volume depends only on the knob's current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a dynamic system is the **longitudinal speed of a car**. A specific depression of the gas pedal does not correspond to one specific speed, because the car's speed depends on both how much the gas pedal is currently pressed and how it has been pressed over time. Other factors such as inertia and friction also contribute, meaning the speed evolves dynamically based on the system's history.\n",

We take advantage of that by **linearizing** nonlinear systems around these spots.\n",
