No matter how much the knob was turned earlier, the current volume depends only on the knob's current position.\n",

    "An example of a dynamic system is the **longitudinal speed of a car**. A specific depression of the gas pedal does not correspond to one specific speed, because the car's speed depends on both how much the gas pedal is currently pressed and how it has been pressed over time. Other factors such as inertia and friction also contribute, meaning the speed evolves dynamically based on the system's history.\n",

    "We can clearly see that if the linearization is done around the equilibrium point, the linear approximation is very good in the vicinity of the equilibrium point. However, as we move further away from the equilibrium point, the linear approximation becomes less accurate and the linear model deviates greatly from the nonlinear one, even becoming unstable."
